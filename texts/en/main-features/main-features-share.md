### Share your datasets

Gitribute allow you to put in a place **a widget that other people can copy and include in their own website**.

Even if the widget is copied, the data source stays the same. That way **you can multiply the number of persons contributing to your data**.

- **Create a set of components for modular uses** :
  - preview for `.csv`, `.md`, `.json` files or `mediawiki` ressources, with several choices for preview (table, cards list, ...) ;
  - files edition interfaces ;
  - dataviz for `.csv` files (barcharts, pies, ...) ;
  - user preferences: language, user token, ...
  - etc...
- **Web integration as modular web component**

> **Note** : More about available widgets, their parameters and options in the **["Documentation"](/docs-widgets-overview)** section.
