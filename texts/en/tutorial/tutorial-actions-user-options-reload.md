### Reload the source file

<div>
  <img
    alt="TUTORIAL-ACTIONS-RELOAD"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multi-coop/gitribute-documentation-content/main/images/tutorial/commented/tutorial-04.png"
    />
</div>

As the file displayed in the widget is stored elsewhere (on a Github or Gitlab repository, or in a wiki), it could be useful to refresh the source data to check if any changes occured while you were editing it.

To do so just click on the <span class="icon"><i class="mdi mdi-reload"></i></span> icon.
