# Tutorials overview

This section aims to give you some hints in using basic features of Gitribute.

Ideally we wouldn't want to write this section at all, given we are trying to design Gitribute as "self-explanatory" : a lot of tooltips are associated to the action buttons, so the user could directly have a glimpse of what every button does without having to jump back and forth to the docs.

But if we're honest we're not 100% sure our UX design skills will ever be enough to satisfy everybody, so those tutorials could be seen as complementary tools to guide new users.

In the illustration and tutorials below you will discover the different buttons usually available for a Gitribute user :
