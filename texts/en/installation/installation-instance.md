If you have some technical skills when it comes to code, you can finally deploy your own instance of Gitribute and use its widgets as you wish.

So please clone/copy/reuse, the only thing you'll need to do is to respect the terms of our licence : 

**We designed Gitribute to be free, so free you shall keep it !**
