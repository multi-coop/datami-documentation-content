# Gitribute widgets overview

Gitribute is not a widget per say, it's a **collection of widgets**.

We are developping several widgets you can therefore include _ad libidum_ onto your own websites.

Each widget has its own specificities, and can work independently or altogether.

Some widgets are specialized in visualizing data from github or gitlab, some to visualize multiple files at once, some in visualizing data from wiki websites...

Our [roadmaps](/software) draws some intentions for the planned future developments. We plan to develop some or all of the following :

- a widget to visualize data tables as charts (dataviz) ;
- a widget to help data owners make triage with the merge requests ;
- a widget to have simple but customized maps from data tables ; 
- ...imagination (and time, money) are the limits.

Those are our ideas of widget to develop, now let's see which are the ones already existing in the Gitribute collection.
