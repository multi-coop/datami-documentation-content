Developping a free software is something particular in the tech industry.

### An idea, and a quick proof it could technically work

As any idea, Gitribute's idea didn't come from a blank void.

The idea takes its roots in various things we experimented and discussed before between associates, along the years. 

- How could we use Git in a more efficient way ?
- How could Git relieve us from many things we don't want to do that much (maintain a backend server for instance) ?
- How can we make something useful and new for the open data movement ?

And as any idea it needed to take a first form to be refined.

The real first pieces of Gitribute's concretization weren't lines of code, they were the [architecture & schemas](/architecture) drawings. And paper is cheap...

We already had some experiences in some technologies, some of we wanted to experiment more with for instance to do widgets.

That laid - **an idea and a plan** - coding the "backbone" structure for the Gitribute project was just a matter of a couple of days.

### Real use cases

We worked with **real user cases** since we started to develop Gitribute, even in its early releases.

We begun to develop the first bricks of Gitribute as responses to one, then two, then three clients sharing what we considered as similar needs.

Doing so we can **have real feedbacks** along all the development cycles.

Those first clients allowed us to **begin quickly**, with **short development cycles,** in an "agile" process, and deliver bricks responding to their specific needs.

_[Do it agile or do not, there is no try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4yd2W50No)..._

The fundings corresponding to those first issions payed for the POC alone.

### Mutualize needs  & converge with the roadmap

The main principle we try to follow when it comes to fund the developments of a product like Gitribute.

- Open source is not a hobby, it's a job. You need missions to fund it ;
- A product should respond to expressed needs ;
- Development on a product could benefit several clients, even if they don't know one another ;

During our carreers we could observe many actors in need for developments are emphasizing their own particularities when comparing themselves to others. 

_[Nothing new under the sun](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissisme_des_petites_diff%C3%A9rences-)..._

Small differences, while - sometimes - huge similarities...

But you can find if you are searching for it : you will only find similarities if you take the time to analyze individual needs altogether.

Many problems benefit from this patient time of analysis, factorization, optimisation that constitutes the effort of **mutualizing problems to find a common solution**.

In the digital industry the very advantage we have is that a problem's solution could be very flexible over the time, through each of its steps of its development...

But once more, only if though as such and if one is willing to make the effort.

### Valorize our expertise, not the code

No subscription nor private data will be generated from Gitribute to our benefit.

We won't make a dime from the code itself, but it doesn't mean Gitribute won't help our cooperative to grow.

**Gitribute is a growth vector from several perspectives** :

- It could be used as a pedagogic tool for us to **help organizations opening their data**, and as such in need for our expertise ;
- It could be a way to **work on more complex cases**, where organizations need to produce open data over open data, schema, and APIs ;
- Our technical **skillset grows** as we develop and innovate, **so is our global value as a structure**.
